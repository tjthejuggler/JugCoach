VI. Detailed To-Do List & Timeline
A. Phase 1 (MVP) – Estimated Duration: 2-3 months

    Project Setup & Architecture Design

Set up a new Kotlin project in Android Studio.
Establish the MVVM architecture and project module structure.
Create the Room database schema for patterns, session logs, and notes.

    Define data models (Pattern, Session, Note, Settings).

Legacy Data Import

Develop a JSON parser for the legacy juggling patterns.
Map legacy fields to the new data models.

    Create a simple UI to display the imported patterns.

Basic Session Logging

Implement a “Start Session” / “Stop Session” button.
Log basic session data (start/stop time, selected pattern, catches, duration).

    Create a simple form for self-reported inputs (e.g., mood, fatigue).

Conversational UI & LLM Integration

Build a basic chat screen supporting text input.
Integrate voice input (using Android’s speech-to-text).
Set up API key management in settings.
Implement the LLM API call with a system prompt that includes basic context (e.g., “Your last session stats,” “Available patterns,” etc.).

    Display LLM responses in the chat interface.

Basic Analytics & Visualization

Implement a simple dashboard screen that aggregates session data.
Create basic charts (e.g., a line graph for catches over time) using an Android charting library.

    Provide a “View Raw Data” screen.

Settings & Data Export

Develop a settings screen for API keys and preferences.

    Implement a manual data export feature (export JSON).

Testing & Feedback Loop

Internal testing for data integrity, UI responsiveness, and LLM interactions.

        Collect initial user feedback to adjust the MVP scope.

B. Phase 2 – Estimated Duration: 3-4 months

    Enhanced Session Logging & Contextual Data

Expand the session log schema to include additional self-reported metrics and contextual data.
Implement optional prompts for additional metrics (fatigue, environment, etc.).

    Explore basic sensor data capture (if permissions are granted).

Advanced Conversational Features

Enable the coach to modify pattern metadata (tags, difficulty) during conversation.
Store conversation notes and integrate them with session logs.

    Develop mechanisms to record and differentiate between user- and coach-generated suggestions.

Refined Analytics & Custom Dashboards

Add options for customizable charts and dashboards.
Implement periodic report generation (e.g., weekly summaries).

    Create interactive chart features (drill-down on specific data points).

Improved LLM Context Management

Build a summarization module to condense historical data before sending context.
Enhance the system prompt with detailed instructions for data read/write access.

        Test using multiple API keys/models and document performance differences.

C. Phase 3 – Estimated Duration: 4-6 months (Post-MVP)

    Personalization & Coach Personas

Develop options for switching coaching “personalities” and modes.
Implement internal logging to track which suggestions are most effective.

    Allow dynamic adjustment of the coach’s tone based on long-term performance.

Wearable & Sensor Integration

Implement sensor-based detection for start/stop events on the watch.

    Integrate real-time performance metrics using available wearable sensors.

Offline Mode & Deferred Sync

Develop a local, rule-based coaching fallback for offline usage.

    Create a robust syncing mechanism for when connectivity is restored.

Cloud Backup & Extended Data APIs

Integrate secure cloud backup for all user data.
Expose RESTful APIs for potential third-party integrations or advanced analysis.
