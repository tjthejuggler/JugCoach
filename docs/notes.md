# Development Notes

## 2024-02-04
- Starting Phase 1 MVP implementation
- Initial focus on data layer: Room database setup and data models
- Will implement models for:
  - Pattern (juggling patterns with legacy fields + extensible properties)
  - Session (practice session logs)
  - Note (coaching notes and conversations)
  - Settings (API keys, preferences)

## Architecture Decisions
- Using Room for local data persistence
- Following MVVM architecture pattern
- Data models will be designed for extensibility to accommodate future metrics and fields
- Will implement a flexible schema that allows for dynamic properties in Pattern model

## Todo Progress Tracking
- [x] Set up Room database and entities
- [x] Create data models
- [ ] Implement JSON parser for legacy data
- [ ] Basic UI for pattern display

## Completed Database Setup (2024-02-04)
1. Created Room entities:
   - Pattern: Core juggling patterns with extensible properties
   - Session: Practice session tracking with metrics
   - Note: Coaching notes, conversations, and knowledge base
   - Settings: App configuration and API keys

2. Implemented DAOs with comprehensive queries:
   - PatternDao: Pattern management with advanced queries for suggestions
   - SessionDao: Session tracking with statistics and analytics
   - NoteDao: Note management with type-based and relationship queries
   - SettingsDao: Settings management with encryption support

3. Added support classes:
   - ListConverter: JSON-based list type conversion
   - DateConverter: Timestamp to Instant conversion
   - JugCoachDatabase: Main database class with singleton pattern

## Next Steps
1. Implement JSON parser for legacy data import
   - Create data transfer objects (DTOs) for JSON mapping
   - Write conversion logic from DTOs to Room entities
   - Add import functionality to PatternDao

2. Create basic UI for pattern display
   - Design list/grid view for patterns
   - Show pattern details with prerequisites
   - Add basic filtering and sorting
